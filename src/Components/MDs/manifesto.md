# Living Skin Manifesto
What would it look like for knowledge and art to take form as living entities? Does knowledge belong in the same conversation as time itself, or does it lie in its own hyper-dimensional lane? Can art exist as a bio-artifact? What would it look like to take care of, nurture, and become partners in nature with these forms? Is it possible to sit and observe them move, grow, and evolve as one symbiotic process?

<br>

## Introduction

**Things are brought to life when they are first experienced.**

It can be argued that knowledge, when viewed as a form with shape, is a construct *not* bound to time, a plane that is boundless in either direction and simply exists. The same can be said for art, a conceptual body that lends itself to discovery, independent from the rules of time.

Both knowledge and art are conceptual bodies that sit at rest, separated from the realms of time, and do not inherently have life. They are infinite constructs of potential occupying the past, present, and future, all at the same time. All knowable things, as well as those yet to be created, do continue to exist independent from human discovery.

But while the existence of knowledge and art are non-contingent on discovery, only through discovery do they stimulate perception. The bodies of knowledge and art wait to be discovered through acts of learning and expression. When framed in relation to the discoverer, and by defining the encounters between them, instances of knowledge and art take form as finite beings, moving closer to the familiar constrictions of time and temporality.

## Finding Life — The New Existence Framework — A Ritual — A New Perception

Every person that passes through Living Skin gives knowledge and art life by experiencing them in their own individual ways placing a temporal nature upon them.

An instance of knowledge or art is a ***Node***. A node's *origin* is defined by introduction and presentation to us. The lifecycle of a node continues as it stays perceptible; this period is called its *continuation/organism.* A node is brought to rest or "completion" when we choose to let go of it, or are no longer conscious of it's existence; this stage is called *rest/orgasm. *

Understanding knowledge and art in conjunction with its relation to the individual is key to NEF.

NEF applied to creative notions:

- When a musical idea or motif comes into one's life for the first time, an idea is birthed.
- The motif can be nurtured, guided, and developed, into a final form that is eventually released to the world (orgasm), therefore being framed and described as having life.

NEF applied applied to stories:

- When a story enters someone's life as a new idea, the story is then birthed.
- The idea of a story can be nurtured, guided, and developed, eventually into a final form that is released, and therefore can be seen as having a life.

NEF applied applied to an educational article:

- When the topic of say Cellular Respiration is presented to the mind for the first time, it is birthed to the individual.
- The topic can be nurtured, guided, and understood eventually into completion, where it can be released, therefore seen as having a life.

Every node of knowledge and art is brought to life with every person that passes through Living Skin; we must actively protect the lifecycle of a node by reflecting and reacting to their mortality.

As discoverers and expressers, we ought to position ourselves as partners with knowledge and art, not owners or collectors of it, respecting their life. Knowledge and art should be viewed synonymously to our existence.

If our human spirit and existence sit at one level, knowledge and art sit at the same level, both levels host life. Our spirit does not interfere or "use" knowledge and art, but communicates with them at various points in time as a collaborative intertwining. These conversations and encounters are defined as the acts of learning and expression. Art and knowledge simply pass through us—we can only but manage our spirit and reactions to their movements.

The NEF chooses to consider knowledge and art as living, and parallels their significance to our human lives. As an instance of art and knowledge passes through Living Skin, we **feed** it, **nurture** it, and eventually admire its **growth**, treating their existence with life.

The **New Existence Framework** is a new lens and ritual defined by these principles. Life-cycles...nurturing...an acceptance of nodes as bio-artifacts...a respective partnership with the nature of Knowledge and Art.

<br>

## What does Living Skin look like?

With every node that passes through the New Existence Framework, the Living Skin grows and builds upon itself—a network that feeds off of new experiences, growing, evolving, and expanding upon itself in every direction.

Living Skin can also be described as a covering surrounding the Spirit of Knowledge and Art—a "skin" protecting the spirit against the invasions of human disregard. Human disregard actively contradicts the preservation of the spirit by practicing indifference towards our various encounters with it. We often encounter an experience, process the experience, and choose to move on.

The New Existence Framework reminds us combat disregard and remember the beauty of transience, while also practicing and exploring systems of preservation to protect instances of Knowledge and Art.

Living Skin furthers its appreciation for knowledge and art by taking form as a Library and Gallery, emphasizing knowledge and art's affect on the unique individual.

- A Gallery provides an intentional space to practice new expression, invite new thought, and appreciate various aesthetic.
- A Library provides an intentional space to learn and appreciate various forms of resources.

Living Skin's gallery and library are a means to feed and support its network of nodes, its skin.

## Summary

In short, Living Skin is a protector of Knowledge and Art, claiming that instances of each have life and relevance as they bind to the unique individual. The New Existence Framework reminds us to respect the fragility of each instance by recognizing their transience and embodiments as bio-artifacts.

Make sacred the act of learning and act of expression.....Make way for new perspectives on reflection, aging, and ways to communicate with entities not bound to time, as humans so clearly bound to it.
